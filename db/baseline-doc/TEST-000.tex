\section{Overview}

The new \opsim v4 codebase makes significant changes when compared with the previous \opsim v3 software. These include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Separation of the telemetry and telescope control simulation software from the scheduler software. These two packages are now called \texttt{Simulated Observatory Control System} (\socs) and \texttt{Scheduler}. 
\item Implement communication between \socs and \sched via DDS, a publish/subscribe protocol that will be used to communicate between various telescope control systems, including the scheduler code.
\item Update the slew time cost function, to add further flexibility to prioritize short slews.
\item Add an additional `cost' to changing the filter, to reduce the number of filter changes and in particular, fast filter changes.
\item Add a per-filter skybrightness calculation, using the \simsky package to calculate skybrightness values. This updates the skybrightness values to a model that includes a much higher fidelity twilight component and which has been validated against all-sky measurements from the LSST site. It also means that for each visit, the skybrightness limit is compared against the actual skybrightness estimate in the individual filter, instead of just against the $V$ band skybrightness as in \opsim v3.
\item Add the capability to restrict observations to a specified number of visits in a particular filter for a given field, per night. {\it E.g.}, limit visits for a given field to only 2 in $g$ band. This does not mean that no other visits to the same field will take place in the same night, but they would be in other filters which still have available groups. 
\item Add the capability to balance observations between different proposals, as a function of progress toward the total number of requested observations. {\it E.g.}, space the 180 visits per field for the South Celestial Pole proposal over the entire survey, at the same pace as the 825 visits per field for the Wide Fast Deep proposal, so all proposals span the entire survey.
\item Add the capability to add a per-proposal `airmass bonus`, which adds a preference for low-airmass observations to the observation ranking algorithm.
\item Add the capability to add a per-proposal `Hour Angle bonus`, which adds a preference for low-hour angle observations to the observation ranking algorithm. 
\end{itemize}

Here we present a select list (see Table \ref{tab:runlist}) of simulated surveys created with \opsim v3 and v4, to illustrate the effects of these new features.

\section{Summary of skybrightness changes}

One of the major updates between \opsim v3 and v4 was the introduction of a higher fidelity sky brightness model, including a model for twilight. 

The \opsim v3 model was based on \citet{1991PASP..103.1033K} (K\&S), which provides a $V$ band sky brightness based on field airmass, lunar distance, and lunar phase. The \opsim v3 model added varying color terms appropriate for different lunar phases, along with a significant (but constant) bump in skybrightness to 17.0 \magasq to model twilight. The $y$ band skybrightness was additionally modeled as constant at 17.3 \magasq during the night to reflect a lower sensitivity to lunar brightness.  The big jump in sky brightness during twilight, combined with sky brightness limits set in the configuration files, in practice typically prevented filters other than $z$ and $y$ band being used during twilight\footnote{Sometimes observations were taken with \opsim v3 which violated the specified sky brightness limits. These were usually due to calculating the sky brightness values prior to twilight and caching the results through the transition to twilight.}.

\opsim v4 uses the \simsky package \citep{2016SPIE.9910E..1AY}, which is based on the ESO SkyCalc Sky Model Calculator  (v1.4) for non-twilight sky brightness calculations with an added empirical twilight sky model. The sky brightness calculated for each field depends on the field alt/az position, the lunar alt/az, the lunar phase, the sun alt/az, and the filter of the observation. It includes contributions from emission from the upper and lower atmosphere, scattered starlight, scattered moonlight, and zodiacal light, along with an additional component of scattered sunlight during twilight (sun altitude between -11 and -20 degrees). The transitions into and out of twilight are much smoother, and notably, the twilight sky can be darker than the specified sky brightness limits even in $u$ band near zenith. Thus in runs produced with \opsim v4.1, sometimes observations in $u$, $g$, $r$ or $i$ are taken during twilight due to a simple hard-limit on the sky brightness. It is possible to set these limits strictly enough to avoid this, however then some non-twilight observations at higher airmass, smaller distances to the moon, or at greater lunar phases, will also be ruled out, leaving significantly less flexibility in scheduling `normal' observations. In the future, the hard-limit will be replaced by a soft-constraint bonus, such as a preference for observations closer to the theoretical darkest sky brightness possible at a given time.

To evaluate the effect of changing the sky brightness model, we first reprocessed the previous baseline, minion\_1016, using \simsky. The overall changes in skybrightness range between from very slight (in $r$ band) to almost a magnitude decrease in skybrightness (in $z$ band). In general, the sky brightness gets fainter; $r$ band is the only filter where it gets brighter, and this is a very small change. These changes are {\it after} including the observing conditions for each observation -- thus these results are averaged over a variety of lunar phases, airmass values, and field pointings. The effect the skybrightness reprocessing is consistent whether it is evaluated simply for all observations in a given bandpass or  for observations at a particular point in the sky in a given bandpass (see Tables~\ref{tab:medskybright} and \ref{tab:medhealpixskybright}. We see roughly similar skybrightness values in \opsim v4 run astro-lsst-01\_2020, which was intended to reproduce minion\_1016 behavior, as it did not use any additional new features introduced by \opsim v4, even though v4 is now choosing observations based on the actual \simsky values in each bandpass (see Figure~\ref{fig:skybrightness}).

The values for astro-lsst-01\_2020 are very similar to the distribution seen in minion\_1016, even though \opsim v4 makes decisions for field pointings based on a knowledge of these skybrightness values in each filter at each pointing, information which was not available for \opsim v3. The changes in skybrightness, and resulting changes in 5-sigma limiting magnitudes, we see due to reprocessing minion\_1016 are thus reasonable to expect in new \opsim v4 runs.

\section{New baseline survey recommendation}

The SRD places requirements on the amount of sky which receives a given minimum number of visits (table 22) and the number of visits over a given minimum area (table 23). Together these specifications are that 18,000 square degrees should receive at least 825 visits (together known as the `fO' metrics). The performance of each of these simulated surveys regarding this important metric is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:srd}. The top panel in the figure illustrates the minimum number of visits an 18,000 sq degree area receives (Nvisits/825 line) and the amount of area covered which receives at least 825 visits (Area/18k sq deg line).  The bottom panel illustrates the changes in the number of visits in each simulated survey, together with the `effective time' of each survey. Effective time is defined as the equivalent amount of on-sky time a survey would require to reach the same limiting magnitudes as the total coadded depths, assuming all observations were actually taken in a fiducial set of observing conditions. If the actual observations are obtained in bad conditions (high airmass, bright sky backgrounds), the effective time is smaller; if observations are taken with good conditions, the effective time is larger.

In the v3 baseline, minion\_1016, the SRD fO metric values were relatively high, as the overall number of visits was larger. With \opsim v4, the airmass or hour angle bonuses add preferences for observations in better conditions (closer to the meridian) but which result in longer slew times. This reduces the overall number of visits but increases the effective time of the survey. The fO metrics fail when these bonuses are set to particularly strong values, primarily because the observations are spread more unevenly over the sky. Observing close to the meridian in some regions of $RA$ is difficult due to the arrangement of the Deep Drilling fields and the North Ecliptic Spur. With a fewer number of overall visits, this pushes some areas down below the benchmark (825 visits) value, causing these fO metric values to fall below the required thresholds.
