## Docker introduction 

A generic introduction to Docker and how to run docker containers is available on
the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/). 

A short overview of the LSST docker options is contained in the slides at 
https://github.com/lsst-dm/wom_pub_presentations/blob/master/EUROPE3-2018/StackDeploy.pptx

More information on the MAF and OpSim docker containers and how to run MAF/Opsim within 
these containers is available in the specific READMEs in this directory: [MAF](maf_docker_readme.md) and
[OpSim](opsim4_docker_readme.md).
